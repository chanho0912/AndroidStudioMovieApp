To select by person name(actor/actress) or by title

### kenburnsview
I designed the image slider using kenbusview.

### Paper db
I saved the last information I searched and tried to recover it when the app ran again.
Search information remains even if it is forced to end while using the app.
I saved it in db every time the recycler view adapter was changed using paper db.

### Using Firebase db to User login
